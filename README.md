### Topic
  This Article describes approaches to solve problems using machine learning. Most of the problems which can't be solved with general programming can be solved using Machine Learning.
  
## Machine Learning
  A program which can solve a problem P by learning from data D and improves its accuracy A overtime.

ML Algorithms are classified as Supervised Learning or Unsupervised Learning.

#### Supervised Learning
  In Supervised Learning there is a connect between input and ouput i.e. the data is labelled. We know how our input and output looks like. 
  
  Eg: 
    1. Data representing patients and whether a patient has cancer or not.
    2. Data representing features of houses(size, # of beds etc) and price of the house based on these features.
    
    Supervised Learning is further divided into two problems.
    1. Classification Problem: Given labelled data falling into N number of classes, we have to predict which class the sample falls under.
